"Ode to the Gentleman's Game"

Beneath the burning summer sun, on fields both green and wide,
Where willow meets the leather ball, and dreams refuse to hide,
There echoes loud a timeless sound — the crowd’s resounding cheer,
For cricket lives in every heart that holds the game most dear.

From village lanes to grandest grounds, from dust to shining turf,
It binds the prince and peasant both, from ocean unto surf,
The bowler’s stride, the batsman’s stance, the keeper’s silent crouch,
Each moment steeped in poetry — the calm before the pounce.

I. The Dawn of Play

The umpire lifts his finger high, the fielders start their hum,
Eleven men in spotless whites await what’s yet to come.
The openers stride like poets bold, to pen their morning tale,
While seamers storm like tempests wild — unyielding, fierce, and pale.

The cherry glows, it cuts the air, it swerves and spins and dips,
The batsman watches every move, his mind on edge and lips,
He meets the ball — a crisp sweet sound, it races through the green,
A blur of red, a streak of joy — perfection in between.

II. The Rhythm of Battle

The scoreboard grows, the tension builds, each run a war well fought,
Each maiden over whispers deep, “Be patient, as you ought.”
The spinner loops a web of guile, with fingers full of art,
He dances slow, he draws you close, then breaks your careful heart.

The wicket falls, the crowd erupts, the slips leap in delight,
The batsman walks, head slightly bowed, but eyes still burning bright.
For cricket’s soul is not in wins, nor loss, nor fleeting fame,
It breathes within the noble way each player guards the game.

III. The Gentleman's Spirit

When shadows lengthen, tea is poured, old rivalries grow mild,
The fiercest foes share laughs again, as if they’ve reconciled.
For though the bat may split the air, and tempers sometimes flare,
The spirit of the game remains — its soul beyond compare.

Sportsmanship, that ageless creed, defines the noble way,
To fight with heart yet shake the hand that felled your side that day.
No war of words can ever drown the song the game imparts,
For cricket is not just a match — it’s stitched into our hearts.

IV. The Legends Live Forever

O Bradman’s grace, O Tendulkar’s calm, O Lara’s golden flair,
O Warne’s great spin, O Kapil’s roar that filled the English air.
O Dravid’s wall, O Gilchrist’s flash, O Muralitharan’s eyes,
O Imran’s poise, O Stokes’s fight beneath the cloudy skies.

The names may fade with passing years, but tales forever burn,
Of matches won on final balls, of glory hard to earn.
Each boundary struck, each diving catch, each over tight and tense,
Becomes a chapter carved in stone, of courage — pure, immense.

V. The World Unites

From Eden Gardens’ thundering roars to Melbourne’s evening glow,
From Karachi’s heat to Lord’s old charm where whispered legends flow,
From children chalking stumps on walls to pros on sacred grass,
This game dissolves all borders drawn — all barriers, all class.

A billion hearts beat as one pulse, a thousand tongues but one,
For cricket is a melody the world has just begun.
It humbles kings, it crowns the meek, it heals what wars divide,
A sport, a faith, a fellowship — the world’s unending pride.

VI. The Eternal Game

And when the floodlights dim at last, and silence floods the field,
The echo of the bat and ball still hums — it will not yield.
For every child who dreams tonight, with bat beneath the bed,
Will one day write another verse, where heroes’ feet have tread.

The game will live beyond the years, beyond the hands of men,
For every match is born anew each time we play again.
So bow your head, salute the pitch, the stumps, the pads, the flame,
For there will never be a sport as sacred as this game.
